🚀 30 Days of Projects: Learning Python, Go, and Ruby
In this repository, I embark on a learning journey to gain proficiency in three programming languages: Python, Go (also known as Golang), and Ruby.

📝 Purpose
The main objective of this challenge is to learn through building practical projects. While I had some prior knowledge of Python, Go and Ruby are entirely new to me. I'm using these projects as personal training, allowing me to explore the unique features, syntax, and capabilities of each language.

📅 Itinerary
Here's the list of projects I plan to complete over the next 30 days:

Unit Converter: A simple unit converter that supports various categories such as length, mass, time, and more.
...
...
... (add all the projects you plan to tackle)

Final Project: Short description of the last project.
🧰 Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python, Go, Ruby
Development Environment: VS Code, GoLand, RubyMine ... (or any other IDEs you're using)
Version Control: Git and GitHub
🙌 Contributions
Although this repository is primarily for my personal training, I'm always open to feedback and suggestions! If you spot anything that could be improved or have insights on any of the languages I'm diving into, please feel free to open an "Issue" or "Pull Request".
